# PawPoint-Directory

PawPoint Directory is a project I decided to start after my cat went missing, which led me to realize there wasn't an easy way to search for vet & shelter contact information. Google searches were time exhaustive and when you're searching for a missing pet, time is critical. 

This is a work in progress, so please bare with me while I continue building out my vision for this directory.

## Features  
- Searchable directory by city & state or zip code.
- Integration with Petfinder API for shelter data
- User-friendly interface to locate local resources quickly
